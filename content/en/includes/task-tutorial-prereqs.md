This tutorial requires: 

* An active Kubernetes cluster, of 1 control plane host and 2+ worker nodes.
    - If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by following the steps in this [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/) tutorial, or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:
        * [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
        * [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
        * [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)
* The `kubectl` command-line tool, of version 1.14 or higher.
